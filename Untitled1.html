<h2> Robert Yang's Bio!</h2>
<p> Welcome to Robert Yang's Bio! As you can see below, this is a picture of him. Robert Yang graduated from UCLA at age 15. He later became a tech lead for Google. After taking several semesters off from college, he realized that life is not as easy as someone imagines. Robert Yang knows several programming languages for example: Java, Python, Ruby, C++, PHP, HTML, and C. Robert Yang likes to invest his time at Las Vegas, where he goes to casinos and wastes all of his well-earned money. Although his assistant is writing this Bio because Robert Yang is so "busy",I can assure that this is the most realistic Bio someone has ever written for him.   </p>
<p> Although he struggled, Robert Yang always seeked help. This resulted in him graduating the first in his class with Honors! After working as a tech lead for google for 15 years, he decided to teach at the high school level. Robert Yang loved it so much that he decided to dedicate all of his life teaching! <p>
